## 📖 Overview

A Python script that generates unique, colorful **snowflake fractals** using the `turtle` graphics module. It simulates the random nature of snowflakes by creating them in varying sizes, colors, and positions across the screen.

## ✨ Features

-   **Generative Art**: Creates 20 unique snowflakes per run.
-   **Randomization**: Random coordinates, sizes (1-4), and colors (white, blue, purple, grey, magenta).
-   **Animation**: Watch the snowflakes being drawn in real-time.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    python sf1.py
    ```
2.  **Watch**: The "Elsa" turtle will draw the winter scene.
3.  **Exit**: Click on the window to close it.
